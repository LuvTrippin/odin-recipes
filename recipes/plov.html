            <li>1 tbsp. cumin</li>

        <h2>Instruction</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the rice several times with cold water to remove all the starch (the water should run clear at the end). Pour in cold water and leave while everything else is prepared.</li>
            <li>Cut the onion into thin half rings.</li>
            <li>Cut the carrots into medium cubes.</li>
            <li>Cut the meat into pieces (rather large).</li>
            <li>In a large, thick-bottomed saucepan (or cauldron), heat about half the vegetable oil well. Add the onion and fry for about 5 minutes until translucent and lightly golden.</li>
            <li>Add meat, fry with active stirring, for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the rest of the oil, add the carrots, fry for about 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add barberry, cumin (I rub it with my fingers to release the aroma). Also add turmeric, salt and pepper well.</li>
            <li>Stir, pour in about a glass of boiling water so that the meat is slightly uncovered. Insert the garlic heads, peeled from the outer layer of peel. Simmer over low heat, covered, for about 30-50 minutes or until the meat is completely soft (be sure to check this moment).</li>
            <li>Next, pour rice (without water) onto the meat and carefully smooth it out (do not stir).</li>
            <li>Carefully, so as not to disturb the layer of rice, pour boiling water from the kettle so that the rice is covered with water by 2 cm (do not stir). Add some more salt. Cook for about 10-15 minutes over low heat (during this time, most of the water will be absorbed into the rice).</li>
            <li>Then make several holes with the handle of a spoon to allow steam to escape, close the lid and cook until cooked for about 15-20 minutes. Please note that during the process of preparing pilaf, we absolutely do not stir it, thatâ€™s when you will get real pilaf, and not rice porridge with meat.</li>
            <li>Gently stir the finished pilaf, literally in two or three movements, from bottom to top, just enough to barely mix the rice with the meat. Or, if it is expected that a large number of people will eat the pilaf at once, place a large deep dish on the pan, and in one sharp movement turn the pilaf onto the dish (the meat will be on top).</li>
